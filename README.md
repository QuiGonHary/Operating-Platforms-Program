The Gaming Room – Software Design Reflection

Client and Requirements
The client was The Gaming Room, a company that makes a game called Draw It or Lose It. They wanted me to design software that would let their game run on different platforms and work in a distributed environment. The game needed to support multiple teams and players, and each game and team name had to be unique.

What I Did Well
I think I did well in explaining the different platforms and how the design would work on them. I also made sure the document was organized in a way that made sense and was easy to follow.

Helpful Parts of the Process
Writing out the design before jumping into code helped me think ahead about the structure of the program. It made me see problems before they came up and gave me a plan to follow when coding.

What I Would Revise
If I could revise something, I would spend more time on the security part. I mentioned some basic ideas, but I think I could have gone into more detail about how to keep the system safer.

Understanding the User’s Needs
I made sure to include the user’s needs by focusing on making the game scalable and making sure teams and games had unique names. Thinking about the user’s needs is important because if we don’t, the software won’t really solve their problems.

My Approach to Software Design
My approach was to first look at the requirements, then compare options, and finally write down the design. I used pros and cons lists and thought about which solutions fit best. In the future, I would like to use user stories and diagrams earlier to help connect the design better to what the users want.
